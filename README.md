# ðŸ“¦ SCM Demand Prediction Using LSTM

This is a Python-based Supply Chain Management (SCM) project that processes historical product usage data and predicts future demand using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. It includes a GUI for ease of use and connects to a MySQL database.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Load data from an Excel file and/or MySQL database.
2. Preprocess and scale the data using a saved MinMaxScaler.
3. Feed the data into a trained LSTM model (`supply_demand_lstm.h5`) to predict future demand.
4. Show the results using a simple `tkinter` GUI.
